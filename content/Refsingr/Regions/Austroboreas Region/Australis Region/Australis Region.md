The southern Region of Austroboreas, for a long time this region was only inhabited by small groups of nomads and people from the [[Southern Wilds]]. When [[The Dominion of Aether's Children]] started settling in the region and driving the nomads out they banded together becoming [[The Great Steppe Khanate]] and now hold much of the power in this area.

The Australis Region contains:
[[The Principality of Glenmore]]
[[The Kingdom of Redania]]
[[The Order of the Silver Sword]]
[[The Great Steppe Khanate]]
